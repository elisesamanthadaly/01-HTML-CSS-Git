# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The Horiseon webpage now has a title, sequential headers, semantic HTML elements, and image alt attributes. The goal of these additions is to increase both the page's accessibility for users on e-readers and position in search engines. A broken nav link was also fixed ("Search Engine Optimization"). The CSS for the webpage has been consolidated and restructured so as to follow the semantic structure of the HTML.

You can view the new page [here](https://elisesamanthadaly.github.io/1-30-21-Homework/).
